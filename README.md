I've decided to keep up my programming practice (begun while trying to find a new job in 2018) by writing code each day in 2019 (or at least as often as I can!), beginning by running through all the challenges at adventofcode.com, because they look both fun and doable in an hour or less each day. (I will update this README as I turn to other challenges.)
